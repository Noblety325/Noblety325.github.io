        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore with a Communication major and a minor in psychology. </p>
         <p>
            I enjoy walking, reading, archery, being with my friends, and sleeping. I want to one day be able to get a good job to support a family and make it so they don't have to worry about being poor and can enjoy themselves.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy helping out at my church back home. I don't really have one here right now but I am still looking.
